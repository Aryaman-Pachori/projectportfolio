## About Me

My name is **Aryaman Pachori**, and I graduated in **June 2024** with a **B.S. in Math and Computer Science** from UCSD. Over the years, I have gained diverse work and internship experiences that align with my passion for technology and problem-solving.

- **Internship Experience:**
  - At **NeuroLeap**, I was part of the software team, building frontend components for report cards assessing neurodivergent children's performance metrics. My work supported special education curriculums across California schools.
  - During my **study abroad in Madrid**, I interned with **Urban Roosters**, a startup focused on Latin American rap battle content. I developed machine learning algorithms to enhance platform engagement, integrating data analysis with creative entertainment.

- **Academic and Personal Projects:**
  - A **computer graphics project** using OpenGL and C++ to create a ray tracer.
  - A **machine learning project** predicting credit default risks, utilizing TensorFlow, Scikeras, and AWS QuickSight for modeling and visualization.
  - Contributions to **LingoHero**, a language-learning app where I developed frontend screens with React Native and integrated backend functionality using Firebase.

- **Current Role:**
  - I work as a **Field Tech Expert for Asurion**, where I provide technical support and troubleshooting for various consumer technologies. While this role has honed my client-facing skills, I am eager to transition into roles involving **software development**, **data science**, or **product management**.

I am a natural collaborator with an **outgoing personality, strong communication skills**, and a knack for connecting with people. I thrive in dynamic, multicultural environments, such as my current living situation in a communal pod housing in San Francisco, which mirrors the energy of a college dorm. Here, I’ve strengthened my ability to collaborate with people from various backgrounds.

Beyond my professional and technical pursuits, I am passionate about **dancing**, having trained in **contemporary and jazz** from the age of 7 to 16. I also enjoy **working out, cooking, exploring history**, and spending time in **nature**. These activities keep me grounded and creatively inspired.
